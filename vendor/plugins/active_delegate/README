ActiveDelegate
==============

Provides ActiveRecord with the ability to talk to multiple databases from a single model.

# app/models/master_database.rb
class MasterDatabase < ActiveRecord::Base
  handles_connection_for :master_database # <-- this matches the key from our database.yml
end

# app/models/animal.rb
class Animal < ActiveRecord::Base
  delegates_connection_to :master_database, :on => [:create, :save, :destroy]
end

TODO: Add more documentation
